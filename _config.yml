description: I'm a programmer from California specializing in web development. Initially in Java, a small stint in C#, now focusing on the MEAN stack(Mongo, Express, Angular, Node). I make web apps that I think people would like to use. If there's anything I need, its community inspection so please call me out on my bs.
