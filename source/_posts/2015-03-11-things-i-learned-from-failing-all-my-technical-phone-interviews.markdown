I just had a long month of technical phone interviews from numerous companies that I got from the technical job hunting service <a href="http://hired.com">hired</a>. Its funny, you don't truly learn until you've actually made mistakes in a scenario that actually matters. In this case, I think I learned a ton of lessons from getting rejected from all my phone interviews.

<b><i>preface!</i></b>   
I have tried to remain objective in my learnings but there may be hints of bitterness here and there on the account of, you know, failing all my technical interviews.

<h2>The only winning move is not to play</h2>
Interviewing is a losing game. All applicants are losing, its just a matter of losing the least.  From the time you make that first greeting the clock starts ticking and you're already losing. Your interviewers are expecting you to finish a task in a certain amount of time and once finished will compare your time and performance to that of your peers.  They are not looking for things that will impress them but rather for things that will reduce their opinion of you.  There is no way to 'win' an interview, only a way to lose the least. Say too many things that rub the interviewer the wrong way and you're out of the race.  

<h2>The odds are stacked against you</h2>
A typical technical interview path usually involves five or more gatekeepers you have to pass. You usually have to impress the each of the following people in order to advance to the next level

  <li>non technical Company Recruiter</li>
  <li>technical phone interviewer #1</li>
  <li>technical phone interviewer #2</li>

  <li>Take home assignment</li>
  <li>onsite interviewer #1</li>

<i>The amount of interviewers has been expanded to indicate a nightmare interviewing scenario. Your interviews will probably not look like this, but is not outside the realm of impossibility</i>

Remember earlier when I said that technical interviews is a losing game? Imagine a scenario where you are actually a really good engineer (unlike me haha!), and you have a 99% chance of passing through each gatekeeper. This means that you ultimately have a 84% (.99^17) chance of passing through each gatekeeper and landing that job.  The odds are good, but not guaranteed.  Now imagine if you're a good engineer but you're no Linus Torvalds and you have a 95% chance of making it through each phase. That means you ultimately have a 41% (.95^17) chance of impressing everyone and getting the job of your dreams. If you're not within the top echelons of programming you might as well start practicing burger flipping because the only thing you'll be engineering is the perfect .99c cheeseburger at McDonalds. Okay, that was mean, but my point is, you can be very good at what you do and still be rejected because of a interview with a gatekeeper going very wrong, and that's okay!  

<h2>Fail Fast. Try Again</h2>
Its okay to fail at these interviews. Failing a phone screen doesn't say anything about your character or intelligence. Say you have a 40% chance of getting past all the gatekeepers and landing a job. The probability of you landing that job at the first company you interview at is 40%, <code>1 - P(successive failures)</code>. The probability of you landing that job after two seperate company interviews is at 64%. The of landing the job after three seperate company interviews is 79%! Okay lets say you're a average engineer and you have an 80% chance of making it through each gatekeeper.  We first calculate the probability of you getting past each gatekeeper and landing the job (.80^17) 2%. Ouch, you have a 98% chance at failing to get a job at a company with 17 gatekeepers. Now we figure out if you only apply to companies that all use 17 gatekeepers in their employee process then you will have a 2% (1 - .98^1) chance getting in on your first try 4% chance on your second (1 - .98^2), 6% on your third (1 - .98^3), 8% on your fourth (1 - 98 ^ 4) okay you get the picture.  The thing is, is that interviews are not all cut and dry like a math problem.  There's a lot of things you can't control  such as the amount of interview gatekeepers and your probability of acceptance as an engineer for the position.  While we can't ever get our acceptance probability to 100%, we can definitely do some things to improve those odds?

<h2>Do not be yourself</h2>
Its kind of psychopathic, but do not be yourself.  Be prepared to take on a persona of the most attractice engineer that has ever graced this planet.  Never admit to anything that might be a negative unless you're backed into a corner.  Never admit to using 

<h2>Remember Culture Fit</h2>
One of the most disparaging reads I've read was about an interviewer that was gunning for Google. If you haven't read this blog, take a look at some of the <a href="http://iwillgetthatjobatgoogle.tumblr.com/archive">articles</a>. This person is dedicated, has a goal, and a company in mind.  Seems pretty intelligent and very motivated.   <a href="http://iwillgetthatjobatgoogle.tumblr.com/post/19790649528/unfortunately">Unfortunately</a> about four months into the blog creation and after ~120 articles about programming and computer science concepts, he does not make it.  Even after answering all the questions correctly (granted, there is no way to validate this other than taking his word for it).
