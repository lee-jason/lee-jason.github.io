Let me preface this by saying that I understand why frameworks exists.  They solve repeatable problems in application development in a team environment by maintaining consistent standards with tried and tested techniques that stood the test of time against thousands of projects and developer input that's supposed to ultimately save the developer time.  That's great, that's all really great.  But, if it takes the user longer to develop the application with the framework than without it, then you have a framework dealbreaker.

I don't know if I'm stupid with an inability to parse an incredibly large amount of information in a short amount of time but I have incredibly bad luck with frameworks. 

Here's my process in learning a new stack/language/library.  Build an application as bare bones as possible.  Have a good time reading the base documentation. Finish the application and learn about the basic elements of the application.  Move onto learning popular framework of that stack/language/library. 
A. run into errors building/installing/initializing the framework. 
B. get overwhelemed from the amount of features I'm not going to use in the framework.
C. framework requires me to fiddle with numerous xml files of configuration before I can get started on logic.
D. further down the line, framework goes against principles of base stack/language/library

These are all framework dealbreakers and are absolute frustrations when trying to become more efficient.
