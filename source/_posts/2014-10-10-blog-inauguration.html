<p>Hi, my name's Jason and all these other programming blogs told me that I should start writing.  I've been reading alot about how programmers that write assist in the thinking and solidifying process. It allows you to process what you've just learned and requires you to actually regurgitate it into words that are actually comprehensible. This process will increase understanding by exploring holes of unknown as I reason through it. This is my attempt at being a better person and hopefully a chance to help someone.</p>

<p>In reality I just wanted a outlet to explode my jumbled self-justified 'brilliant' thoughts that I probably have already been discussed to death but I just discovered for the first time.  I guess everyone has to start somewhere and this is where I'm starting.</p>
<p>A little about me. I'm a programmer who graduated from the University of California Irvine with majors in Information and Computer Science and Music. I enjoy playing the guitar although I don't think I'm getting any better anytime soon. I used a lot of Java in school to learn the theory of CS graduated and decided to pursue the web as a platform of expression. I ended up at my first real job at where they provided web software as a subscription service using a Microsoft web stack. The position was for front-end development which at the time I did not appreciate but I was glad that I had an opportunity to prove myself. </p>
<p>As of this post I'm currently unemployed. While I did quickly get moved from a junior position to the standard developer role, and won multiple internal awards and nominations for my consistency in delivering. I decided that I would grow faster as a person if I were to reinvest my daily eight hours into myself rather than the company. I do not want to go too into the reasons for departure but the roles and projects that I was assigned to involved mostly overhead management, scheduling, and very little development.  I understand that every programming position in every company needs to deal with bureaucracy, overhead, schedules, and meetings.  I don't mind that I really don't!  Casual distractions don't really bother me.  Its just that when you finally get to the programming and it just involves changing the text value from a line of html, then I get no satisfaction from my job. I appreciate all the mentors that I had for the three years that I've been there and I will take all their advice and teachings to my next career.</p>
<p>So that's where I am now.  I have a mess of newly found front-end knowledge, re-brushing up on my backend work with node.js, and some patience to not rush into a new position that I won't thoroughly enjoy.  I hope I can truly fulfill the moniker the saying 'If you truly love your job then you'll never work another day in your life' or something like that.</p>
